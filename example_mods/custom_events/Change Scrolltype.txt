Changes the Scrolltype (WIP)
      Value 1 or 2:                    (Value1)      (Value2)
                'off' is to switch to Upscroll or Sidescroll
                'on' is to switch to Downscroll or Middlescroll
                'swap' is to switch between them
      Extras:
                'default' is to switch to Default Scrolltype

More maybe soon?                           ...Who knows...
